# daily-calendar
This application is a daily calendar. The page is broken down into hourly sections for the standard working day. The user can save text for each hour - it is stored in local storage so sustains a page refresh. The date changes automatically to the current day using JavaScript and the user is notified of each successful save.

The application can be found at: https://steve4098.github.io/daily-calendar/
